# Artificial Sensor Reporting

This is a Databricks pipeline that takes [artificial sensor data from PubNub](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/realtime-data-streams/sensor-network/) and builds a real-time stremaing pipeline with reporting.

It is just meant to show what is possible and enable me to train on Databricks, and not be a best practice reference or anything to that level.
